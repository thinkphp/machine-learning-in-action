# Standard Deviation

Standard deviation is a number that describes how spread out the values are.

A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are close to the mean (average) value.

A high standard deviation means that the values are spread out over a wider range.

Example: This time we have registered the speed of 7 cars:

```
speed = [86,87,88,86,87,85,86]
```

The standard deviation is: 0.9

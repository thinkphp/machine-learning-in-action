# Machine Learning

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

* Machine Learning is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics.
* Machine Learning is a step into the direction of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
* Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.

In the mind of the computer, a data set is any collection of data. It can be anything from an array to a complete database.
